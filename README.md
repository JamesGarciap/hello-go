# Learning GO with test

This repository is a playground for learning GO while following the book **Learn Go with test**.
The goal for this repo is to keep track of my learning process and documment aspects of the languages I consider key
and extra relevant for covering the GO learning curve.


## Commands handbook

### Execute a go program
```bash
go run hello.go
```

### execute tests
```
go test hello
```
